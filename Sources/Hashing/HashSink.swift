/**
 *  Keeps a record of types.
 *
 *  This structure allows the lookup of types using their hash values. This is
 *  similar to Set and Dictionary, however, this structure does not store the
 *  actual values and instead only stores the hash values. This leads to (in
 *  most cases) a huge reduction in memory for algorithms which do not need to
 *  keep values in memory and instead only wish to know if a particular value
 *  has already been processed.
 *
 *  - Attention: Since this uses the swift standard library `Hasher`, please
 *  do not persist this structure as there is no guarantee that the hash values
 *  will be the same between different executions.
