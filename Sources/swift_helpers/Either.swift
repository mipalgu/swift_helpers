/**
 * A value which represents a possible choice between two distinct types
 * of values.
 *
 * `Either` provides the ability to specify two types of values for a field.
 * `Either` is similar to the concept of `Result` as well as `Optional`.
 * `Optional` and `Result` both model the idea of specifying two cases of
 * values --- the existence of a value or not in the case of `Optional` and
 * success or failure in the case of `Result`. `Either` represents the more
 * general case of simply having two types of values. `Either` represents
 * these two cases as either `left` or `right`.
