     *  Reduce a sequence into a single value.

     *  sequence only contains 1 element then that element is returned,
     *  otherwise, the result of `transform` applied to all elements
     *  in order is returned.
     *
     *  This function is helpful, for example, when combining strings:
     *
     *  ```
     *  let data = ["first", "second", "third"]
     *  let result = data.combine("") { $0 + " " + $1 } // "first second third"
     *  ```
     *
     *  Use this function over reduce if your sequence may contain only one
     *  element:
     *
     *  ```
     *  let data = ["first"]
     *
     *  // Handling single element sequences using combine:
     *  let result = data.combine("") { $0 + " " + $1 } // "first"
     *
     *  // Common erroneous use of reduce:
     *  let result = data.reduce("") { $0 + " " + $1 } // " first"
     *
     *  // Correct handling of single element sequences using reduce:
     *  let result = data.dropFirst().reduce(data.first ?? "") { $0 + " " + $1 } // "first"
     *  ```
     *
     *  - Parameter failSafe: A value that is returned if the sequence is empty.
     *
     *  - Parameter transform: A function that combines two elements into a
     *  single element.
     *
     *  - Returns: A single element which is the result of combining all
     *  elements within the sequence into a single element.
     *
     *  - Complexity: O(n)
